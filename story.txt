There is a universe far, far away call the Ruineterra. And there's a huge kingdom call Demacia. Their country was build upon an ancient war cause by magic. The 
survivors of the war fled to this piece of land and build Demacia. Hence, the people and their children sees magic as a sort of "evil" power, and it is prohibited
in Demacia. In this kingdom, there are two families who guards the kingdom for centuries. One of them are the royal family of the kingdom, and the other one 
protects the royal family. But one day, a baby girl who was borned in this family, finds out she has the power of magic herself...

Riding home one fateful night, Lux and her horse were attacked by a ravenous sabrewulf pack. In a moment of fear and desperation, the young girl let loose a
torrent of magical light from deep within her, routing the beasts but leaving her shivering in fear. Magic, the terror of Demacian myths, was as much a part
of Lux as her Crownguard lineage. Fear and doubt gnawed at her. Would she become evil? Was she an abomination, to be imprisoned or exiled?
 At the very least, if her powers were discovered, it would see the Crownguard name disgraced forever.

With Garen spending more time away from High Silvermere, Lux found herself alone in the halls of their family home. Still, over time, she became more familiar
with her magic, and her sleepless nightsfists clenched, willing her inner light to fadebecame fewer and fewer. She began experimenting in secret, playing with 
sunbeams in the courtyards, bending them into solid form, and even creating tiny, glowing figures in her palm. She resolved to keep it a secret, as much as she 
could.
