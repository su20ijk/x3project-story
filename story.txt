There is a universe far, far away call the Ruineterra. And there's a huge kingdom call Demacia. Their country was build upon an ancient war cause by magic. The 
survivors of the war fled to this piece of land and build Demacia. Hence, the people and their children sees magic as a sort of "evil" power, and it is prohibited
in Demacia. In this kingdom, there are two families who guards the kingdom for centuries. One of them are the royal family of the kingdom, and the other one 
protects the royal family. But one day, a baby girl who was borned in this family, finds out she has the power of magic herself...

Riding home one fateful night, Lux and her horse were attacked by a ravenous sabrewulf pack. In a moment of fear and desperation, the young girl let loose a
torrent of magical light from deep within her, routing the beasts but leaving her shivering in fear. Magic, the terror of Demacian myths, was as much a part
of Lux as her Crownguard lineage. Fear and doubt gnawed at her. Would she become evil? Was she an abomination, to be imprisoned or exiled?
 At the very least, if her powers were discovered, it would see the Crownguard name disgraced forever.

After years studing the power of magic, she suddenly realized that she was in a game called lol. So she laughed out loud: "hahahahahahaha".

It seems that after five years Lux comes back to the real world again. Her brother Garen is so happy to see that Lux recovers from the traumatic brain injury, which results in continous imagination, caused by a car accident five years ago.Garen carries a top, and top keeps spinning on the table.

Garen was sent to the hospital along with Lux. They have to stay there for another three months until they both get back their health. But besides that, they finally 
get to reunion and they will support each other forever.
